# chui

## Description

`chui` is a small VR UI library for the [LÃ–VR](https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr) framework, exploring the VR manipulation of UI. Instead of laser pointers the users reach out and push  the UI elements, using their finger tips or controllers. Elsewhere called diegetic UI, or Direct Touch method.  chui stands for *c*ompact *h*aptic *u*tility *i*nterlink, and is so tiny it has to be written in lowercase. 

The UI is handled in retained mode - you create panels & add widgets only once during UI initialization. Stored references to widgets and panels can be modified in runtime as needed. For an immediate mode UI library check out [lovr-ui]().

```lua
chui = require'chui'

panel = chui.panel()
panel:label { text = 'hello world' }
panel:layout() -- aligns widgets in vertically centered rows

panel.pose:set(0, 1.5, -2,  math.pi, 0,1,0) -- rotate panel to face us

-- update not needed for passive label
function lovr.draw(pass)
  chui.draw(pass)
end
```

The UI can also run in desktop VR simulator with mouse control. In simulator the left mouse button still rotates camera and the right button operates UI elements.


### Layout

Panel is a container for one or more widgets. It can optionally (by default) render its back side.

The panel stores a list of vertically centered rows, each row is filled with widgets.

```lua
panel = chui.panel()
panel:label{ text = 'button >' }
panel:button()
panel:row()
panel:label{ text = 'toggle >' }
panel:toggle()
panel:layout()
```

At the end of panel definition, the `layout()` function is called to arrange widgets.

Each widget receives allocated space inside its row. More or less space can be requested by the `span = 2` in widget init table. The whole row is vertically centered inside the panel. Layout function also calculates the overall panel dimensions for the frame rendering.

This simple and flexible layout scheme has one downside - the 'columns' inside each row don't align automatically, so it is not a true table grid. Sometimes spacers are needed to adjust the vertical alignments between two rows.

Skipping this layout method also works. Widgets can also just be manually positioned by modifying their `.pose`  matrix, which is relative to the panel's own `.pose`. Note that widgets should be oriented in +Z direction to face away from the panel.

### Options

When creating the panel, we can specify some parameters:

```lua
chui.panel{ frame = false, palette = chui.palettes[3] } -- frame=false omits drawing the back-panel 
```

The library has few widgets, with listed parameters and their defaults:

- spacer - blank space widget for aligning other widgets

  `{ span = 1 }`  

- label - simple centered text

  `{ text = '', text_scale = 1, span = 1 }`

- button - push button with callback function

  `{ text = '', thickness = 0.3, callback = nil, span = 1 }`

- toggle - on / off button with state-changed callback

  `{ text = '', thickness = 0.3, state = false, callback = nil, span = 1 }` 

- glow - a LED showing on/off state, with optional label on it

  `{ text = '', thickness = 0.1, state = false, span = 1 }`

- progress - a horizontal bar representing a numerical value

  `{ text = '', value = 0, span = 1 }`

- slider - horizontal knob that controls a numerical value

  `{ text = '', min = 0, max = 1, value = 0, step = nil, thickness = 0.15, callback = nil, span = 1 }`




## Dependencies

`chui` uses cutting-edge lovr features (`roundrect`!) which currently only exist on the `dev` branch. There are available build artifacts in lovr's Github Actions section.

At the moment `chui` is dependent on `lovr.headset` module and cannot work on 3D desktop apps that disable it.

The `chui.lua` can use these two optional files:

- `lovr-mousearm`  is required only in desktop VR-simulator mode, included for convenience
- `RussoOne-Regular.ttf` is under Open Font License; without it the built-in 'Varela Round' is used 

## Demos & utilities

Few apps are included in subdirs, that can be used for example code or reused elsewhere.

##### testapp

A collection of all the widgets for testing, and a basic palette switcher/editor. 

Color editing is enabled with *F1*, this brings up the orb with edited color.

*F3* selects which color in palette is currently edited

Using horizontal and diagonal gestures (trigger + motion or right mouse + motion), the color is modified across the hue, saturation and lightness axes.

When done editing the palette, press *F4* to print out your fancy new palette in the console.

*F2* cycles through predefined palettes.

![chui-palettes](media/chui-palettes.gif)

The included `colorizer.lua` library has some useful color conversions for HSL and hexcode formats.

##### vkeyboard

A basic virtual keyboard with a minimal text entry field.

![vqwerty](media/vqwerty.png)

The `vqwerty.lua` is reusable module that creates the virtual keyboard panel. The pressed keys are registered as key events in `lovr`. Code is easily adaptable to numpad or dvorak layouts. 

##### sequencer

Functional sequencer with 4 tracks and volume & pitch control.
